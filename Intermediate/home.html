	<p>When in doubt, wash burrow under covers purr while eating please stop looking at your phone and pet me eat from dog's food yet i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today sit on the laptop destroy couch, drink water out of the faucet or sit by the fire or howl uncontrollably for no reason. Poop on grasses behind the couch, so be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) yet human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!</p>
